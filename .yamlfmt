  # There is a "bug" with the behaviour of this option that will move file head
  # comments below the initial document start. For example front matter is
  # rearraged and therefore misplaced in the file. This behaviour prevents

  # There is missing functionality in `yamlfmt` to remove redundantly quoted
  # strings from YAML documents, and prefer the use of double quotes (or
  # whatever is configured). This means further manual effort is required to
  # correct files.
